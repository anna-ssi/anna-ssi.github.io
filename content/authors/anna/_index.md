I am a Research Assistant at the University of Alberta working with <a href="https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/">Martha White</a>. I have completed my MSc degree in Computing Science under the supervision of Martha White in the <a href="http://rlai.ualberta.ca/">RLAI Lab</a>.  Prior to that, I obtained a BSc from the National Polytechnic University of Armenia (NPUA) in Information Technologies (IT).

My current research is focused on online reinforcement learning, particularly on designing adaptable agents that can learn tasks robustly, even as their surroundings change. In my MSc thesis, I explored how adjusting various hyperparameters could enhance this adaptability.

Lately, I've become increasingly interested in the concept of agents that are aware of their limitations - whether computational or otherwise - and capable of recognizing and adapting to changes they've made in their surroundings. I believe this _self-awareness_ could help with more efficient learning and the emergence of agency. Ultimately, my goal is to develop methods compelling enough to attract interest from psychologists to study agent behaviors.
