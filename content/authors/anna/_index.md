      My Master's thesis explores online hyperparameter tuning in reinforcement learning, where an agent adapts its hyperparameters during interactions rather than relying on a pre-tuning phase.

I am a Research Assistant at the University of Alberta working with <a href="https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/">Martha White</a>. I have completed my Masters degree in Computing Science under the supervision of Martha White in the <a href="http://rlai.ualberta.ca/">RLAI Lab</a>.  I completed my bachelor's of IT at the National Polytechnic University of Armenia (NPUA).

My lifelong goal is to understand the human mind, which is the primary reason reinforcement learning (RL) picked my interest. Thus, my current research interests and work are about single-lifetime continual learning agents. I am reviewing materials about animal learning and human behaviorism, which are, I believe, the key to unlocking learning principles for lifelong agents.
