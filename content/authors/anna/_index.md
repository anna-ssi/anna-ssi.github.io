I am a Research Assistant at the University of Alberta working with <a href="https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/">Martha White</a>  in the <a href="http://rlai.ualberta.ca/">RLAI Lab</a>.  

My current research centers on online reinforcement learning (RL), specifically developing methods that dynamically tune hyperparameters during allocated agent-environment interactions. I have also contributed to designing partially observable never-ending environments to evaluate an agent's adaptability in dynamically changing settings. I also study how rich, diverse, task-agnostic observations can enhance an agent's abilities across simple and complex RL environments. 

I have recently developed a keen interest in quantifying the amount of information an agent needs for efficient decision-making, especially in a partially observable setting. I am interested in exploring capacity-constrained agents - agents with constraints on the information they can get about the world they live in.
